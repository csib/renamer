# renamer
Renames any file or folder and strip out special characters recursively.

I have faced a problem when try to upload files to OneDrive with my Synology NAS. There were many bad characters in file names and folder names. So I decided to write a little program to rename them.

This program will rename and strip out the not valid characters. (See 12th line in code.)

How to run?<br/>
From command prompt in Linux type:<br/>
python3 main.py

I windows you have to install Python3, then to the same.
